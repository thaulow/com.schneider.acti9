Monitor your Schneider EcoStruxure energy devices in Homey using Modbus TCP.

This app connects to your EcoStruxure Panel Server, Smartlink SI D, or PowerTag Link gateway and automatically discovers all connected Acti9 PowerTag energy sensors. It supports the full range of PowerTag M63, F63, P63, and NSX models in both single-phase and three-phase configurations.

Each PowerTag reports real-time power consumption, cumulative energy usage, voltage, current, power factor, frequency, and temperature. Three-phase devices provide individual readings for L1, L2, and L3.

Simply enter your gateway IP address and the app will scan for devices and add them to Homey. Configure the polling interval to balance between update frequency and network load.
